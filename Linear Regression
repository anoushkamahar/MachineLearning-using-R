###VARIABLE 3: Total Faculty
#Prediction of what we will get based on the relationship (pos/neg;strong,weak,moderate) when put in context

#Given the correlation of Total Faculty was about .4 (positive, moderate) with FTRetentionRate, 
#we should expect to see the model to have a positive relationship between these variables as well

#linear model assigned to a variable
lmTotalFaculty <- lm(FTRetentionRate ~ TotalFaculty, data=Case2)

summary(lmTotalFaculty)
coef(lmTotalFaculty)

#Equation: FTlmTotalFaculty = 72.705429781 + 0.007367571 * TotalFaculty

#There is a positive relationship between these variables, with Retention increasing by 0.0073
#percentage points for every university's total faculty
#The intercept slope and intercept both have significant p-values at <0.0000000000000002
#which may indicate that total faculty can be a predictor since it is less than 0.05

#lmTotalFaculty notes that  that 390 observations were deleted due to missingness
#Our residual standard error is 11.28, meaning the deviation from true value
#of retention could be off by 11.28
#this number would be useful to compare with RSE of a model
#using log(TotalFaculty) to determine which has the better fit

#Lastly our R-sq value is 0.1385, meaning that this model is
#able to explain 13.85% of the variation in the data

abline(lmTotalFaculty, col = "red")

##While the line does capture a good amount of the data, 
#it is clear that most of the observations are clustered around 0-1000 faculty
#members, 
#with a good number of observations quite far from the regression line
#this data would likely better be modeled with a log of TotalFaculty

##This makes sense, as resources and finances are limited in university, hence
#schools would have as limiting number of faculty as possible to keep the salary 
#expenses under control. Hence most of the total faculty is packed between the 
#0-1000. However, there are several points that deviate from the line and have
# a larger amount of faculty with varying retention rate. 

#Normalized Residuals - Normal or Skewed
hist(lmTotalFaculty$residuals)
mean(lmTotalFaculty$residuals)

#The histogram of residuals is centered around 0 (mean: 2.650859e-16)
#however, the graph does #appear to be skewed left which is likely because
#those early observations well below the regression line

#Homoskedasticity - BPTest
lmtest::bptest(FTRetentionRate ~ TotalFaculty)

##The Breush-Pagan test gives us a p-value of 0.2882,
#clearly showing that they  the model is likely heteroskedastic, 
#failing this assumption

#Remaining assumptions with plot of lmTotalFaculty
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(lmTotalFaculty)

#By plotting the residuals with the fitted values, we first see that
#there are both residuals that are positive and negative but 
#with a much larger skew towards negative
#In fact, there are a great deal of negative residuals at the start of 
#the data that are very far from the model
#What this all implies is that the data is not linear, and we have a great
#deal of potential outliers

#By looking at the  Normal Q-Q plot, we see that there are 
#several observations pulling away from the line.
#These negative residuals are over 3 standard deviations from the model, 
#while the positive residuals tend to follow the line and are no more than
#3 standard deviations from the line

#The plot of the fitted values with the square root of standardized residuals
# shows us a somewhat bottleneck pattern in the data as the observations get 
#less spread out. This again proves that the data is heteroskedastic and not random.

#Although we see multiple outliers in residuals vs leverage graph, none
#of them cross the Cook's distance. 

#A recommendation to see the relationship better between these variables is to 
# change the model altogether instead of ommitting observations. 



#Explanation of model in context

#The linear model tells us that increasing the number of total faculty
#will increase retention rate. However, this model does not have the best fit. 
#Therefore, it is recommended to use the log(Tenured) to better capture the
#relationship. 

#Why do we care?
#Education is a big part of society and higher education is a vastly 
#influencing part of the global environment. Hence, it is crucial for us
#to see what factors to gauge or alter so that the educational institutes 
#can have a sustainable system while still giving a good education to its students.
#Having the right amount of faculty will definitely aid students and help 
#universities reach optimal graduation retention rates. Too little of faculty will
#spread proper supervision too thin, thus decreasing the education quality for students. 
#However, unnecessarily large faculties will be a grave and inefficient expense for 
#universities, which will decrease education institutes stability and sustainability.
