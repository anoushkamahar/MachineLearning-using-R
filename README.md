The Linear Regression code is an analysis of a dataset where we try to see whether there is a relationship between final year students retention rate and total faculty in 100s of universities. The code checks whether the relationship fills all the assumptions including linearity, normalized residuals, homoskedasticity etc. Additionally, the file ends with a description of the relevance of the analysis done in the file. 

The Multiple Regression code follows the same procedure as Linear Regression code and carries further on. It uses forward, back and forward-back step procedure to narrow down the most influential dependent variables. Additionally, the data is trained and tested against the linear model to see if the model predicted well. 

Similar procedure is used in the final code, except LDA, QDA and KNN models are also incorporated to see which model would yield the highest accuracy rate. Furthermore, the best estimate model is applied on K-fold validation CVV technique to observe if it can increase the previous model's accuracy.
