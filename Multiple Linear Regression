#The dataset is a dataframe with 400 observation and 12 variables with different
#types such as integers, numbers and factors
summary(Credit)
#The variables covered are ID, Income, Limit, Rating, Cards, Age, Education,
#Gender, Student, Married status and Balance where Ethnicity only has three 
#factors (African American, Asian and Caucasian)


Credit <- Credit[,-c(1,8,9,10,11)]


lmBalance <- lm(Balance~.,data=Credit)
summary(lmBalance)
#Insignificant p-values- Cards, Age, Education
#variables= Income, Limit, Rating, Cards, Age, Education

lmBalancestep <- step(lmBalance, direction="both")
summary(lmBalancestep)
#Forward step did not remove any variables
#Backward step removed Education
#Both step removed Education too

#Hence Education will be removed as its p-value was very high and 2 of the 
#steps removed that variable
#It is risky to eliminate any more variables as removing them without further
#calculations can omit potentially valuable information

lmBalance2 <- lm(Balance~.-Education,data=Credit)
summary(lmBalance2)

#Insignificant p-values- Cards, Age
lmBalancestep2 <- step(lmBalance2, direction="both")
summary(lmBalancestep2)
#Forward did not remove any variables
#Backward did not remove any variables
#Both did not remove variables


#lmBalance3 <- lm(Balance~.-Education-Cards,data=Credit)
#summary(lmBalance3)

#lmBalancestep3 <- step(lmBalance2, direction="both")
#Removed Card and the adjusted R square still did not change
#That means we keep going

#lmBalancestep4 <- lm(Balance~.-Education-Cards,data=Credit)
#summary(lmBalancestep4)

#We remove Age too because it is still insignificant
#lmBalance4 <- lm(Balance~.-Education-Cards-Age,data=Credit)
#R square value still did not change so we eliminate it, but it decreased
#a lot when I removed income or limit, so the final equation is
#lmBalance4 <- lm(Balance~.-Education-Cards-Age,data=Credit)
#OR -445.10477 -7.61268*Income + 0.08183*Limit



car::vif(lmBalance)
#Looking at the answers of vif function that looks at multicollinearity, 
#we are removing Rating as its ratings are too high (more than 200)

lmBalance21 <- lm(Balance~.-Rating, data=Credit)
car::vif(lmBalance21)
#After removing ratings, all vif ratings were normal


##Provide your final regression equation: 
#Equation: -445.10477 -7.61268*Income + 0.08183*Limit

plot(lmBalance)
mean(lmBalance$residuals)
#3.233798e-15 (very close to 0)
hist(lmBalance$residuals)
#A little right skewed but the mean is still 0 and most of the data revolves
#around 0 with a few outlier reaching to the 3rd sd. 
summary(lmBalance)


#It seems that income and limit are variables that determine
#a person's balance with Income having an inverse relationship. Although Age is
#also one of the factors, its p-value is more than 0.05 but it is still 
#in the model as it did not interact that much with other variables and is also 
#the variable that has an inverse relationship (negative slope)
